# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources: 

1. [Register of Members’ Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/), 
1. [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
1. [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/). 

You can [search and explore the results](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627) through the collaboration’s interactive database. Simon Willison [has extracted a database](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish) and this is what we will be working with. If you want to read more about [the project’s methodology](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/).


## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database

```{r}
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(sky_westminster)
```

## Which MP has received the most amount of money? 

You need to work with the `payments` and `members` tables and for now we just want the total among all years. To insert a new, blank chunk of code where you can write your beautiful code (and comments!), please use the following shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `cmd + option + I` (mac)

```{r}
# Check the column names in the payments table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "payments")

# Check the column names in the members table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "members")

# Check the column names in the appg_donations table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "appg_donations")

# Check the column names in the appgs table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "appgs")

# Check the column names in the member_appgs table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "member_appgs")

# Check the column names in the parties table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "parties")

# Check the column names in the party_donations table
DBI::dbListFields(sky_westminster, "party_donations")

# Connect to the database
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)


# Assign each table to its own variable
parties_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "parties")
payments_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "payments")
members_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "members")
appg_donations_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "appg_donations")
appgs_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "appgs")
member_appgs_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "member_appgs")
party_donations_database <- DBI::dbReadTable(sky_westminster, "party_donations")

# Close the database connection
DBI::dbDisconnect(sky_westminster)



# Find the MP who has received the most amount of money
merged_data <- merge(payments_database, members_database, by.x = "member_id", by.y = "id")
mp_totals <- aggregate(value ~ name, data = merged_data, FUN = sum)
mp_with_most_money <- mp_totals[which.max(mp_totals$value), ]

# Print the MP with the most amount of money received
cat("MP with the most amount of money received:\n")
cat("Name:", mp_with_most_money$name, "\n")
cat("Total Amount:", mp_with_most_money$value, "\n")

```

Theresa May is the MP who received the most amount of money.

## Any `entity` that accounts for more than 5% of all donations?

Is there any `entity` whose donations account for more than 5% of the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval? Who are they and who did they give money to?

```{r}



# Extract the year from the "Received in" format
extract_year <- function(date_string) {
  parts <- strsplit(date_string, " ")
  year <- as.integer(parts[[1]][length(parts[[1]])])
  return(year)
}

# Filter payments data for the 2020-2022 interval
payments_filtered <- subset(payments_database, extract_year(date) >= 2020 & extract_year(date) <= 2022)

# Calculate the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval
total_payments <- sum(payments_filtered$value)

# Calculate the percentage of payments given by each entity
entity_totals <- aggregate(value ~ entity, data = payments_filtered, FUN = sum)
entity_totals$percentage <- (entity_totals$value / total_payments) * 100

# Filter entities with donations accounting for more than 5%
entities_over_5_percent <- subset(entity_totals, percentage > 5)

# Print the entities and their corresponding recipients
cat("Entities whose donations account for more than 5% of total payments:\n")
for (i in 1:nrow(entities_over_5_percent)) {
  entity <- entities_over_5_percent[i, "entity"]
  percentage <- entities_over_5_percent[i, "percentage"]
  
  # Find the MPs who received donations from the entity
  recipients <- subset(payments_filtered, entity == entity)$member_id
  mp_names <- members_database$name[members_database$id %in% recipients]
  
  cat("Entity:", entity, "\n")
  cat("Percentage of total payments:", percentage, "%\n")
  cat("Recipients (MPs):", mp_names, "\n")
  cat("\n")
}





```


... and then, based on this data, plot the following graph. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_graph.png"), error = FALSE)

library(lubridate)

# Convert the date column to Date format
party_donations_database$date <- as.Date(party_donations_database$date)

# Filter party donations data for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022
party_donations_filtered <- subset(party_donations_database, year(date) %in% c(2020, 2021, 2022))

# Calculate the total donations for each party in each year
party_totals <- party_donations_filtered %>%
  group_by(party_id, year = year(date)) %>%
  summarize(total_donations = sum(value)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Order parties by total donations in descending order for each year
party_totals <- party_totals %>%
  arrange(year, desc(total_donations))

# Retrieve the party names
party_names <- parties_database %>%
  select(id, name)

# Merge party names with party totals
party_totals <- party_totals %>%
  left_join(party_names, by = c("party_id" = "id")) %>%
  mutate(party_name = ifelse(is.na(name), "Unknown", name))

# Generate a color palette for highlighting parties
party_colors <- c("#FF0000", "#00FF00", "#0000FF", "#FFFF00", "#FF00FF", "#FFA500", "#008080", "#800080", "#FFC0CB", "#008000")

# Create the bar graph
ggplot(party_totals, aes(x = factor(year), y = total_donations, fill = party_name)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = party_colors) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Donations", title = "Volume of Donations for Each Political Party") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Political Party"))
```

This uses the default ggplot colour pallete, as I dont want you to worry about using the [official colours for each party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Index_of_United_Kingdom_political_parties_meta_attributes). However, I would like you to ensure the parties are sorted according to total donations and not alphabetically. You may even want to remove some of the smaller parties that hardly register on the graph. Would facetting help you?  

Finally, when you are done working with the database, make sure you close the connection, or disconnect from the database.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(sky_westminster)
```


# Anonymised Covid patient data from the CDC

We will be using a dataset with [anonymous Covid-19 patient data that the CDC publishes every month](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4). The file we will use was released on April 11, 2023, and has data on 98 million of patients, with 19 features. This file cannot be loaded in memory, but luckily we have the data in `parquet` format and we will use the `{arrow}` package.

## Obtain the data

The dataset `cdc-covid-geography` in in `parquet` format that {arrow}can handle. It is > 600Mb and too large to be hosted on Canvas or Github, so please download it from dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q1yk8mmnbbrzavl/AAAxzRtIhag9Nc_hODafGV2ka?dl=0 and save it in your `dsb` repo, under the `data` folder

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false


tic() # start timer
cdc_data <- open_dataset(here::here("data", "cdc-covid-geography"))
toc() # stop timer


glimpse(cdc_data)
```
Can you query the database and replicate the following plot?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid-CFR-ICU.png"), error = FALSE)



# Filter the data for the specified conditions
filtered_data <- cdc_data %>%
  filter(sex %in% c("Female", "Male"),
         icu_yn %in% c("Yes", "No"))

# Calculate CFR by age group, sex, and ICU admission
cfr_data <- cdc_data %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>%
  summarise(cfr = sum(death_yn == "Yes") / n()) %>%
  mutate(sex_group = paste(sex, icu_yn, sep = "-")) %>%
  as.data.frame()
  

# Create the facet wrap graph
ggplot(cfr_data, aes(x = reorder(age_group, cfr), y = cfr)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  facet_grid(sex ~ icu_yn) +
  labs(x = "Age Group",
       y = "Covid CFR % (Case Fatality Rate)",
       title = "Covid CFR % by Age Group, Sex, and ICU Admission") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

The previous plot is an aggregate plot for all three years of data. What if we wanted to plot Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) over time? Write code that collects the relevant data from the database and plots the following


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-icu-overtime.png"), error = FALSE)
```


For each patient, the dataframe also lists the patient's states and county [FIPS code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code). The CDC also has information on the [NCHS Urban-Rural classification scheme for counties](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm)
```{r}
urban_rural <- read_xlsx(here::here("data", "NCHSURCodes2013.xlsx")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```


Each county belongs in seix diffent categoreis, with categories 1-4 being urban areas and categories 5-6 being rural, according to the following criteria captured in `x2013_code`

Category name

1. Large central metro - 1 million or more population and contains the entire population of the largest principal city
2. large fringe metro - 1 million or more poulation, but does not qualify as 1
3. Medium metro - 250K - 1 million population
4. Small metropolitan population < 250K
5. Micropolitan 
6. Noncore

Can you query the database, extract the relevant information, and reproduce the following two graphs that look at the Case Fatality ratio (CFR) in different counties, according to their population?


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-county-population.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cfr-rural-urban.png"), error = FALSE)
```


# Money in US politics

In the United States, [*"only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees."*](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs)

We will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. The data for foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle can be found at https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022. Then, we will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.

All data come from [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a *"website tracking the influence of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens' lives"*.

base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"

contributions_tables <- base_url %>%
  read_html() 

```

- First, make sure you can scrape the data for 2022. Use janitor::clean_names() to rename variables scraped using `snake_case` naming. 

- Clean the data: 

    -   Write a function that converts contribution amounts in `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` from character strings to numeric values.
    -   Separate the `country_of_origin_parent_company` into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.

    repubs = clean_contribution_amounts(repubs)
  )

# Separate country_of_origin_parent_company into country and parent company columns

```




-   Write a function called `scrape_pac()` that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign-connected PAC contributions in a given year. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame.
    -   add a new column to the data frame for `year`. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn't take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the `str_sub()` function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify "last 4 characters".

```{r}
library(robotstxt)
library(rvest)
library(janitor)
library(stringr)

# Allow scraping OpenSecrets.org
paths_allowed("https://www.opensecrets.org")

# Function to scrape PAC data for a given year
scrape_pac <- function(url) {
  # Scrape the data
  contributions_tables <- read_html(url)
  
  # Clean the data
  cleaned_data <- contributions_tables %>%
    html_table() %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    clean_names()
  
  # Extract year from the URL
  year <- str_sub(url, -4)
  
  # Add year as a new column
  cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
    mutate(year = year)
  
  # Separate country_of_origin_parent_company into country and parent company columns
  cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
    separate(country_of_origin_parent_company, into = c("country", "parent_company"), sep = " \\| ")
  
  return(cleaned_data)
}

# Test the scrape_pac function
base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"
pac_data_2022 <- scrape_pac(base_url)

# View the scraped data for 2022
head(pac_data_2022)
```

-   Define the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

```{r}
# Define URLs for different years
url_2022 <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022"
url_2020 <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2020"
url_2000 <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2000"

# Test the scrape_pac function for different years
pac_data_2022 <- scrape_pac(url_2022)
pac_data_2020 <- scrape_pac(url_2020)
pac_data_2000 <- scrape_pac(url_2000)

# View the scraped data for 2022
head(pac_data_2022)

# View the scraped data for 2020
head(pac_data_2020)

# View the scraped data for 2000
head(pac_data_2000)
```

-   Construct a vector called `urls` that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year.

```{r}
# Define the base URL
  base_url <- "https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/"

# Define the years
years <- c(2022, 2020, 2000)

# Construct the vector of URLs
urls <- paste0(base_url, years)

# View the URLs
urls
```

-   Map the `scrape_pac()` function over `urls` in a way that will result in a data frame called `contributions_all`.

```{r}

```


-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `contributions-all.csv` in the `data` folder.
```{r}

```

# Scraping consulting jobs

The website [https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/](https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs) lists job openings for consulting jobs.

```{r}
#| label: consulting_jobs_url
#| eval: false

library(robotstxt)
paths_allowed("https://www.consultancy.uk") #is it ok to scrape?

base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"

listings_html <- base_url %>%
  read_html()

```

Identify the CSS selectors in order to extract the relevant information from this page, namely

1. job 
1. firm
1. functional area
1. type

Can you get all pages of ads, and not just the first one, `https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1` into a dataframe?


-   Write a function called `scrape_jobs()` that scrapes information from the webpage for consulting positions. This function should

    -   have one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame with four columns (variables): job, firm, functional area, and type

    -   Test your function works with other pages too, e.g., https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/2. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?

    -   Given that you have to scrape `...jobs/page/1`, `...jobs/page/2`, etc., define your URL so you can join multiple stings into one string, using `str_c()`. For instnace, if `page` is 5, what do you expect the following code to produce?
    
```
base_url <- "https://www.consultancy.uk/jobs/page/1"
url <- str_c(base_url, page)
```

-   Construct a vector called `pages` that contains the numbers for each page available


-   Map the `scrape_jobs()` function over `pages` in a way that will result in a data frame called `all_consulting_jobs`.

-   Write the data frame to a csv file called `all_consulting_jobs.csv` in the `data` folder.



# Create a shiny app - OPTIONAL

We have already worked with the data on electricity production and usage, GDP/capita and CO2/capita since 1990.
You have to create a simple Shiny app, where a user chooses a country from a drop down list and a time interval between 1990 and 2020 and shiny outputs the following

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "electricity-shiny.png"), error = FALSE)
```

You can use chatGPT to get the basic layout of Shiny app, but you need to adjust the code it gives you. Ask chatGPT to create the Shiny app using the `gapminder` data and make up similar requests for the inputs/outpus you are thinking of deploying.



# Deliverables

There is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown (Rmd) file as a Word or HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas. You must be commiting and pushing your changes to your own Github repo as you go along.

You know enough R (and have enough examples of code from class and your readings) to be able to do this. If you get stuck, ask for help from others, post a question on Slack-- and remember that I am here to help too!

> As a true test to yourself, do you understand the code you submitted and are you able to explain it to someone else?

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
